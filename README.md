  session = #your http client
  client: Search = Search(
      session=session,
      limit=10 # Be mindful what you change, bigger number may cuase you're being blocked by server

       query=#Your song title
    )

    #Getting lyrics e.g
    lyrics: SongData = client.get_lyrics(
       track=tracks[0]
    )
