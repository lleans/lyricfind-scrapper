# Lyric Find Scrapper 🎹

LyricsFind is free online lyrics database, using simple scrapper PyQuery and Aiohttp to grab lyrics from the free-website.

## Option 💽

There's an multiple option on <code>Search</code> class. On there you can change the:

- **<code>teritory</code> iso code e.g 'us'(all lower)** _(optional)_<br>
  The usage of this params is, to limit yourself based on country you are( the default value is by searching your ip location)

  ```python
  from LyricsFindScrapper import Search

  session = #your http client
  client: Search = Search(
      session=session,
      teritory='us'
      )
  ```

- **<code>limit</code> use in params** _(optional)_<br>
  You can change the limit request to service. Defaulting on 10, just be mindful what you do.

  ```python
  from LyricsFindScrapper import Search

  session = #your http client
  client: Search = Search(
      session=session,
      limit=10 # Be mindful what you change, bigger number may cuase you're being blocked by server
      )
  ```

## Function 🪛

There are a few funstions that usable as:

- **<code>get_tracks(query: str)</code> query as params(type str)**<br>
  Just like on the website, you can search an multiple tracks by using the query/title/artist/etc. This will return multiple list of <code>Track</code> class.

  ```python
  from LyricsFindScrapper import Search, Track

  session = #your http client
  client: Search = Search(session=session)

  #Make sure you're on async func.
  #Getting tracks e.g
  tracks: list[Track] = client.get_tracks(
     query=#Your song title
  )
  ```

- **<code>get_lyrics(track: Track)</code> track as params(type Track)**<br>
  The tracks that you already got, pass it here to get the lyrics. This will return class of <code>SongData</code>.

  ```python
  from LyricsFindScrapper import Search, Track, SongData

  session = #your http client
  client: Search = Search(session=session)

  #Make sure you're on async func.
  #Getting tracks e.g
  tracks: list[Track] = client.get_tracks(
     query=#Your song title
  )

  #Getting lyrics e.g
  lyrics: SongData = client.get_lyrics(
     track=tracks[0]
  )
  ```

- **<code>get_translation(track: Track, lang: str)</code> tracks and lang as params(type Track and str)**<br>
  Sometime LyricFind will provide the translation of the lyrics(if it exist. Check on their website). On <code>Track</code> class you can find the <code>available_translation</code>(if it exist) select the language you wanted, pass it on <code>lang</code> as params. It will return you <code>Translation</code> class(identical with <code>SongData</code> only few changes).

  ```python
    from LyricsFindScrapper import Search, Track, SongData

    session = #your http client
    client: Search = Search(session=session)

    #Make sure you're on async func.
    #Getting tracks e.g
    tracks: list[Track] = client.get_tracks(
       query=#Your song title
    )

    #Getting lyrics e.g
    lyrics: SongData = client.get_lyrics(
       track=tracks[0]
    )

    #Getting Translation e.g
    translation: Translation = client.get_translation(
       track=tracks[0],
       lang='en'
    )
  ```
